# INTERFACING-STEPPER-MOTOR-USING-8086-PROTEUS
The Project was completed using Proteus Software, which is used for schematic capture and also, using various other IC's this project was completed, interfacing the IC 8086 with stepper motor was the main motive. Our fellow mates who contributed well had a perfect demonstration of how this project worked.
